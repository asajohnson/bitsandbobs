# Seattle touring idea list

This is a running list of things to consider doing when visiting Seattle. They are generally ordered within the sections by popularity of guests we've entertained. I also put some emojis to designate if you've never been here before and only have 1Ô∏è‚É£ day in Seattle, I recommend these. Or, 2Ô∏è‚É£ days, I recommend these. If I left something off, it's probably not because I don't like it - it's just because it wasn't noteworthy to tell someone of little time in the area. üòä

Feel free to send me other ideas and opinions!
